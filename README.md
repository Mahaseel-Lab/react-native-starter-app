# react-native-starter template

This is a template for react native, it includes a splash screen, react native paper and firebase.

Please note that to get firebase working you need to [generate the android credentials](https://rnfirebase.io/#generating-android-credentials) and add them to your project.

Also you can rename the project using `./scripts/rename.sh`, edit it with the name you want.
